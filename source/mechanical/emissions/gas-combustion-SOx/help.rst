Combustion and SOx emissions
============================

Perform combustion calculations with full flexibility. Fuel can be specified in mole percent or in mass percent. Flue gas composition can be obtained, in 'mole per mole of fuel' or in 'kg per kg of fuel'. The calculations also calculate the SOx emissions in the required units, while correcting for moisture and oxygen levels. The program also provides the flexibility to set the standard conditions for reporting of emission levels if 'mg/Sm3' are chosen as the emission units.
