=======================================
Thermophysical Properties - Water/Steam
=======================================

The inputs include state variables of pressure and temperature for determination of properties for superheated steam or compressed water. For saturated state the inputs required are Pressure-Quality or Temperature-Quality. Outputs include phase information, saturation temperature or pressure and specific volume, enthalphy, entropy, internal energy etc.
