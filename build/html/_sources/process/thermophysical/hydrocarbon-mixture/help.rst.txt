The inputs include state variables of pressure and temperature. Typical composition list of API 617 gas compressors is used. The input include state variables of pressure and temperature. The outputs include crtiical pressure, temperature, compressibility factor (Z), ideal gas specific heat etc. The compressibility factor is determined using Nelson-Obert, LeeKesler and PengRobinson equation of state.
